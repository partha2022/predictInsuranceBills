# PREDICT INSURANCE BILLS

### PROBLEM STAEMENT
In this project we will be using machine learning approaches to build a model which predicts the insurance bills.

### DESCRIPTION OVERVIEW
In this project we extract certain features used to calculate insurance bills for a particular customer.
Such features are 'age', 'sex', 'bmi', 'children', 'smoker', 'region'.

We extracts numbers and nouns by using nltk library from the gather informations by using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

### TECHNOLOGY USE
Here we will be using  Anaconda Python 3.6 , NLTK, Webscraping 

### INSTALLATION
Installation of this project is pretty easy. Please do follow the following steps to create a virtual environment and then install the necessary packages in the following environment.

#### In Pycharm

1. Create a new project.
2. Navigate to the directory of the project
3. Select the option to create a new new virtual environment using conda with python3.6
4. Finally create the project using used resources.
5. After the project has been created, install the necessary packages from requirements.txt file using the command 
    pip install -r requirements.txt

#### In Conda

1. Create a new virtual environment using the command
    conda create -n your_env_name python=3.6
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary packages from requirements.txt file using the command         
    pip install -r requirements.txt
